        <p class="graphics-paragraph">
            Our icons are created to help users visualize what actions they will be. 
            The quotes bubble leads users to our messaging screen with a red icon signaling 
            that they have a notification. For the posts button, we used a plus icon to 
            indicate that users will be adding a new post to their account.

            The button design has two variants, with one of them being our primary color 
            for the app, while the other one is a tint of gray to show that they are 
            secondary buttons.

            The photos used in the app are still shots of dancers. The photos are used 
            to represent our app, which is a dancer agency app helping dancers get hired. 
            These photos are used for posts, highlights, and account profile pictures.

            The hamburger menu showcases the images we use for our app and the icons
            having a consistent colour and design towards them. The menu helps tie the 
            design of our app together with it having the images and icons.
